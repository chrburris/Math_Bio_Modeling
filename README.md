# Model and Simulations of Biological Systems Course
## Virginia Tech, Fall 2016
This course was designed to apply the techniques of differential equations and continuous mathematical modeling to biological systems. For this incarnation of the course we modeled systems in cellular biology. In particular, infectious diseases and HIV. We model these systems using well-known dynamics of infectious diseases pulling from immunology and pathology. 

Models are run (simulated) in Matlab using ode45. We are often interested in whether our model behaves as the literature suggests it should. Namely, if we know that for sustained high levels of infection an individual's immune system will become exhausted, we should see this decreased effectiveness in the immune response in our simulations. 

## Repo Content

There are 2 folders in this repo. 
* *Lab_Project* gives the .m files that code 3 different models pertaining to negative feedback oscillations found in circadium rhythm patterns as well as protein dynamics. 
* *Final_Project* provides the .m files as well as a presentation and a link to an article. The final project for this course was to review and reproduce an article pertaining to cellular biology using ODE models and extend the models in a meaningful way. The project is described in more detail in the README.md file.
