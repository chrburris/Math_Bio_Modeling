These .m files solve 3 different ordinary different equation (ODE) systems that describe negative feedback oscillations. In this case, we consider these systems to describe cellular interactions. 

We start with the Goodwin model, and derive from there the Bliss model and the Goldbetter model for circadium rhythms. 
Each model has an associated ode.m file which corresponds to the ode system to be solved in the original .m file. 

A write up of the behavior of these systems is found in *lab1_writeup.pdf*.
