# Math Modeling Final Project

## Project Outline
The goal of this assignment was to reproduce the findings of an article related to mathematical modeling (continuous ODE model) pertaining to cellular biology. In addition, we were expected to add to the existing model, justify the validity of this extension, and test our resulting model. 

This work was in collaboration with Melody Walker at VT. The link to the original paper we analysed is [here](http://jvi.asm.org/content/85/11/5565.full.pdf+html). 

## Original Article
### *Vaccination Alters the Balance between Protective Immunity, Exhaustion, Escape, and Death in Chronic Infections* 
By Johnson, P. L. et al. 

Research into T cell-inducing vaccines has increased in recent years due to the lack of success with antibody based vaccines in viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is known that CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD8 T cells) play a critical role in limiting
viral replication in infections such as Hepatitis B virus (HBV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and HIV. Many times, the immune response is unable to clear these virus which leads to chronic infection (see Ref. 1). Researchers are interested the efficacy of a
vaccine aimed at increasing CD8 T cell activity. This article models the behavior of T cells and the host pathogen within the body with a 4 dimensional ODE model. The graphical interpretation of this model would look something like this.
